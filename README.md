State space generator for models based on ordinary differential equations. 
Part of BioDivine tool for model checking and parameter synthesis of biological models.

Repository can be added as a dependency to your project using jitpack (See badge above).

## Model Syntax

So far, only supported format of input model file is **.bio** (or **BIO**) format. 
Every model file has to contain at least the following parts:
- declaration of model variables,
- corresponding thresholds (at least two numeric values have to be defined as the lower and upper bound thresholds for each variable), 
- declaration of parameters (each with a lower and upper bound),
- differential equations (one for each variable).  

The corresponding lines start with predefined keywords and have the following syntax (the order of lines is strongly recommended):

- **VARS: _variables_** (mandatory, only one occurrence) where **_variables_** is a list of variable names delimited by comma (**,**).
- **THRES: _variable\_name: threshold\_values_** (mandatory, one for each model variable) where **_threshold\_values_** is a list of at least two **_numeric\_values_** delimited by comma (**,**) and **_variable_name_** is the reference to **_variables_** list.
- **PARAMS: _parameters_** (mandatory, only one occurrence) where **_parameters_** is a list of expressions delimited by semicolon (**;**) in the form **_param\_name, lower\_bound, upper\_bound_**.
- **CONSTS: _constants_** (optional, only one occurrence) where **_constants_** is a list of named constants delimited by semicolon (**;**) in the form **_constant\_name, constant\_value_**.
- **EQ: _variable\_name = equation\_expression_** (mandatory, one for each model variable) where **_variable\_name_** is the reference to **_variables_** list (syntax of the **_equation\_expression_** is defined later in this section).
- **VAR\_POINTS: _var\_points_** (optional, only one occurrence) where **_var\_points_** is a list delimited by semicolons (**;**) of the form **_variable\_name: valuation\_points, ramps\_count_**. Here, **_valuation\_points_** defines the accuracy of the approximation and **_ramps\_count_** defines the number of additional created thresholds, effectively determining the accuracy of the parameter synthesis process.

In the syntax above, the terms **_lower\_bound_**, **_upper\_bound_**, **_constant\_value_** and **_numeric\_values_** are either integers or floating-point numbers (the scientific notation is not supported), while the terms **_valuation\_points_** and **_ramps\_count_** are integers only. _Note that lines do not end with a semicolon (;) or any other special
ending character._

The syntax of **_equation\_expression_** is defined as an arithmetic expression that uses only the operations **+** (addition), **-** (subtraction or unary negation), and __*__ (multiplication). The operands can be either memebrs of **_numeric\_values_**, **_variables_**, **_constant\_name_**, **_param\_name_**, or the application of one of the following functions:

- **_Andrews(var,thr,k)_** is another microbial growth function defind in the following way:
  - <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\texttt{Andrews}(\texttt{var},\texttt{thr},\texttt{k})&space;=&space;\frac{1}{(1&plus;\frac{\texttt{thr}}{\texttt{var}})\cdot(1&plus;\frac{\texttt{var}}{\texttt{k}})}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\texttt{Andrews}(\texttt{var},\texttt{thr},\texttt{k})&space;=&space;\frac{1}{(1&plus;\frac{\texttt{thr}}{\texttt{var}})\cdot(1&plus;\frac{\texttt{var}}{\texttt{k}})}" title="\texttt{Andrews}(\texttt{var},\texttt{thr},\texttt{k}) = \frac{1}{(1+\frac{\texttt{thr}}{\texttt{var}})\cdot(1+\frac{\texttt{var}}{\texttt{k}})}" /></a>
  
where **_var_** is a member of **_variables_** list; **_thr_** is meant to be an important value of interest for the particular variable **_var_** and should be represented as numeric value; all other coefficients (e.g., **_k_**, **_a_**, etc.) are either numeric values or one of the names defined in the **_constants_** list.

### Example:

VARS: x, y

CONSTS: k2, 1; deg\_y, 0.1; a, 1; b, 0; n, 5

PARAMS: k1, 0, 2; deg\_x, 0, 1

EQ: x = k1\*Hillm(y, 5, n, a, b) - deg\_x\*x

EQ: y = k2\*Hillm(x, 5, 5, 1, 0) - deg\_y\*y

VAR\_POINTS: x: 1500, 10; y: 1500, 10

THRES: x: 0, 15

THRES: y: 0, 15
